# School Management Application

Colorado Technical University Group 2's school management application

- This application was developed by Joshua Jenkins, Joshua Frankel, Addison Lewis, Dustyn Bachetti, and Jonathan Espedal
for managing student and teacher information, and classroom management with features such as gradebook and attendance marks.

- This is a finished project, future iterations that were discussed was the possibility of a class scheduler, a proper login
screen, and framework integration for proper deployment to a cloud service for easier updates and version control.

- We learned that Microsoft Access can be good for very basic applications, but for us if we wanted to scale up we could have
invested the time into a proper buildup of a database from the groundup and used an API to connect the front and back-end to
allow easier updates and more clear data dependencies. Something we could have used for this could be PHP.
